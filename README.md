# shoppingList
This project has been completed in its first stage, there are current developments being made.

# first stage:
- basic organisation of recipies and shopping list in google sheets
- alphabetisation of ingredients from various desired recipies

selecting desired recipies:

# potential successive stages:
1. options of how to organise ingredients, alphabetically or according to section in the supermarket (querying library/training machine learning model to identify ingredient class)
2. final ingredients list has same units for every ingredient (changing cups -> ml etc) - would probably require querying a library of some sort to find the corresponding g/ml for imperial cup
3. extracting ingredients from a website and automatically enter data instead of user doing it manually
4. put features into an app
(the last two stages can be interchangable)
